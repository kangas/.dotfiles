# .dotfiles

Dotfiles for your unix-like system. I've created this little repository to setup my OSX development machine. You're free to clone this for your own use, or pull out items.

# Install

To install, you will be cloning this repository into ~/.dotfiles.

	cd ~
	git clone git@github.com:kangas/.dotfiles.git

Then you will activate the .dotfiles by including the following line to ~/.bash_profile

	source ~/.dotfiles/base.sh


# Credits

Borrowing the idea from https://github.com/kevinelliott/.dotfiles but I'm crafting mine from scratch.

PS: Also highly recommended, from the same source!
